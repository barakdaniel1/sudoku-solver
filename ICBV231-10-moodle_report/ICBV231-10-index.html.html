<h3 align="left"> Introduction </h3>
<p align="justify">
    As computer science students, we're most fascinated by solving complicated problems, puzzles and riddles.<br>
    One such example for an interesting logical puzzle is the sudoku.<br>
    <br>
    Sudoku is a popular puzzle game that involves placing numbers from 1 to 9 in a grid of 81 squares. <br>
    The grid is divided into 9 smaller squares, each containing 9 squares. <br>
    The objective of the game is to fill in the grid so that each row, each column, and each of the 9 smaller squares contains all of the numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once. <br>
    <br>
    Sudoku puzzles come in varying levels of difficulty, and solving them requires logical thinking, pattern recognition, and sometimes trial and error.<br>
    <br>
    Sudoku is one of the most famous logical puzzles, and as problem solving students, we chose to dive deep into this puzzle.<br>
    Our goal is to solve any sudoku within seconds, using an image solely.

<h3 align="left"> Approach and Method</h3>
<p align="justify">
We used a flow chart to guide our implementation in order to achieve our goal: <br>
<img src = "./ICBV231-10-flow_chart.png">
<h4>Preprocessing:</h4>In this step, the given image of the Sudoku puzzle is converted into grayscale to reduce color complexity. <br>Gaussian blurring is applied to smooth the image and remove noise so that the edges of the puzzle can be detected more accurately.<br>

<h4>Edge detection:</h4>The Canny algorithm is used to detect edges in the preprocessed image.<br> This algorithm identifies the boundaries between regions of contrasting pixel values.<br>

<h4>Object detection: </h4>boundaries of each object in the image are identified using contour detection. <br>This step helps to identify the Sudoku board's location and size.<br>

<h4>Board extraction: </h4>The Sudoku board is extracted using its geometrical features. <br>Since a Sudoku board has unique geometrical features, the board's corners can be detected, and the image can be cropped accordingly.<br>

<h4>Perspective transformation:</h4>The extracted image is transformed into a fixed size to make it easier to recognize the digits' locations. <br>This is done using perspective transformation, which allows us to change the viewpoint of the image while maintaining the geometry of the objects in the image.<br>

<h4>Image rotation:</h4>At this point, the Sudoku board may be rotated, which can lead to incorrect digit recognition.<br> Therefore, the image is rotated so that all the digits are aligned with the default axes.<br>

<h4>Cell splitting:</h4>The image is divided into smaller cells to isolate individual digits.<br> This is done using the known size of the Sudoku board.<br>

<h4>Digit recognition:</h4>Using an OCR (optical character recognition) model, each cell is recognized and converted into a numerical digit.<br> This information is then placed into a matrix.<br>

<h4>Solving the puzzle:</h4>The matrix of digits is sent to a Sudoku solver, which uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle.<br><br>

<br>Overall, this process combines computer vision and OCR techniques to extract and recognize the Sudoku puzzle's digits, enabling the program to solve the puzzle automatically.

<h3 align="left"> Conclusions</h3>
<p align="justify">
    In conclusion, we saw how concepts and ideas that are learnt in class are actually implemented and used in various scenarios.<br>
    This project was interesting, hard but yet very satisfying, and we are very happy to end up with these results.
